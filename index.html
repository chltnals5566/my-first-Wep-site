  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>Web is a computer programming system created by Donald E. Knuth as the first implementation of what he called "literate programming": the
    idea that one could create software as works of literature, by embedding source code inside descriptive text, rather than the reverse
    (as is common practice in most programming languages), in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers, rather than in
    the order demanded by the compiler.[1] Web consists of two secondary programs: TANGLE, which produces compilable Pascal code from the source
    texts, and WEAVE, which produces nicely-formatted, printable documentation using TeX. CWEB is a version of Web for the C programming language,
    while noweb is a separate literate programming tool, which is inspired by Web (as reflected in the name) and which is language agnostic.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:45px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page.
    It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
